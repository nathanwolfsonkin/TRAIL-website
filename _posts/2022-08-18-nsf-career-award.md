I received an NSF CAREER Award in June 2022 for my project “Formalizing the Concept of Teamwork in Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems.” See also a [Temple news article](https://engineering.temple.edu/news/2022/08/new-nsf-career-award-inspired-robotic-teamwork) about the project and the [official NSF page](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2143312).
