# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

Our research develops algorithmic and systems-level methods that enable teams of autonomous robots to perceive, navigate, and make decisions in uncertain, dynamic, and unstructured environments. This includes distributed multi-robot search, tracking, and information gathering; uncertainty-aware navigation and mapping; scalable coordination for tasks such as cooperative exploration and delivery; and performance prediction for multi-robot teams. We combine probabilistic reasoning, planning under uncertainty, and scalable coordination strategies to bridge theory and practice in real-world robotic autonomy.
