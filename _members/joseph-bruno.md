Hi, I’m Joe! I’m a third-year Ph.D. student passionate about using robotics to improve everyday life. 

My work inherits from human neuroscience and psychology to create robot platforms capable of functioning with and around humans.  

I’m part of the  Department of Mechanical Engineering at Temple University where I work in the Temple Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (TRAIL) under the guidance of Dr. Philip Dames.
