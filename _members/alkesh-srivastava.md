I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the Temple Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Lab, where my research focuses on multi-robot coordination, exploration, and multi-target tracking. Under the guidance of Dr. Philip Dames, I am developing AI-driven decision-making strategies for heterogeneous robotic teams to enhance their ability to navigate, explore, and track dynamic targets in real-world scenarios. Concurrently, I am also a Journeyman Fellow at the DEVCOM U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), where I contribute to cutting-edge research in robotics and autonomy through the prestigious ARL Research Associateship Program (administered by ORAU). Prior to joining Temple University, I served as a researcher at the Motion and Teaming Laboratory within the University of Maryland, College Park, where I earned a Master of Engineering degree in Robotics. During my time at the University of Maryland, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Michael Otte, utilizing probabilistic graphical models and information theory for motion planning of multi-agent systems in communication-denied environments. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electrical Engineering from Rajasthan Technical University.
